          <span><p>In this digital era, people are searching extra ways on how to earn money online. The reason is quite simple, earning online means that you decide what hours you dedicate to making money. Also there is no limit to how much you can earn online by offering your services. Here arises the question:&nbsp; What are those services that helps you to earn a decent amount of money ? Well, I can say in advance there are many services in the marketing to offer but the one we are putting under spotlight is VPN (Virtual Private Network).</p>

<p>VPN’s are quickly gaining popularity in many countries as people are more aware about their online security and privacy, considering it more crucial. &nbsp;While using the Internet, you can never know if someone is snooping your data, especially when accessing public Wi-Fi hotspots which are usually unprotected and not secure. A VPN helps you do your online browsing and transactions through a secure encrypted tunnel, so no one can have access to your data. With no doubt, it is a wise decision to choose such emerging business to offer as part of your portfolio.</p>
<p>There are tons of services throughout the world that offer VPN services, however, you need to look at the bigger picture when choosing a VPN provider to resell it to your customers such as, Price and quality, speed, privacy,&nbsp; reliability and customer support.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESELLING&nbsp; A “VPN”:</strong></p>
<p>if you don’t have enough capital&nbsp; to buy a large portion of bandwidth or technical knowledge to build your own, you can partner up with reselling companies that offer the product and all technical resources you need in order to sell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reselling means that you would use the existing infrastructure of a well-known provider and set your own price and plans. You may go for reselling if you have identified a niche but does not have enough technical expertise to create or own product or rather focus on only selling it.</p>
<p><strong>FIND A PROVIDER:</strong></p>
<p>There is variety of&nbsp; choices pricing option when you dive into a VPN reselling market. Your choice solely depends on what network specs you want and how much you can rely on your provider ability to overcome any possible issues you or your customers may face .&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SETTING SUITABLE PRICE:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The price you put on your service is going to be highly dependent on the price you’re paying for provision in the first place but make sure you’re at least competitive with other resellers.&nbsp;Offering a featured service might help attracting more customers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BRANDING:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Your brand is your business.&nbsp; We will provide the white label software for free or we offer a rebrand service, where we will rebrand it with your own logo, color and style at competitive market price. Custom branding allows you to create awareness of your brand in the market and increase loyalty and credibility. It also distinguish you from the competition.<br><br></p>
<p><strong>AFFILIATE PROGRAMS:</strong></p>
<p>Word “affiliate”&nbsp; is very familiar and you may quickly associate that with the ability to make extra money. Affiliate programs do offer those opportunities and being a VPN affiliate can be lucrative.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most common paths to affiliate marketing success:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CREATING AN AFFILIATE REVIEW SITE:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Affiliate review sites are one of the most common pathways to success. This style of site is dedicated to reviewing different products or services in a certain niche. Setting up an affiliate site might be a great idea ko kickstart your VPN business .</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SELLING AFFILIATE PRODUCTS VIA EMAIL:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Email marketing is a great way to drive traffic to an affiliate offer. By building an email list of people in a certain niche, you can recommend them products they might be interested.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ADD LINKS TO YOUR WEBSITE OR BLOG:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re not completely focused on affiliate marketing, but would like to add some additional income to your online efforts, then you can include affiliate links wherever they make sense. This could be done through a link on your social media profiles or stories, on a separate resource page on your website,</p>
<p><strong><br>DECIDING THE BEST OPTION:</strong></p>
<p>Both <a href="../vpn-reseller.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VPN white label programs</a> and affiliate programs have their own merits and limitations.</p>
<p>The choice entirely depends on your clients needs and how much effort, time and capital you are willing to put into this business.</p>
<p>White Label program is better suited to those who have enough time and resources to make it a success. If you are looking for branding yourself reseller program is suitable for you and it generates a continuous source of income.</p>
<p>If you are already having your own business or run some popular blogs, you might go for affiliate programs&nbsp; and simply direct clients to providers thus generating the side income.&nbsp;</p>
