          <span><p>How to sell VPN and more of it is probably the most asked question our partners ask us. After all building a scalable business is dependant on growth. I've been in Sales in the SAAS space for over 15 years and I'd like to share some tips to help you grow your business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are concerned about your online privacy,&nbsp; want to safeguard your data from third parties, or are considering&nbsp; a way to dodge geo-restrictions, a VPN might help you to cover them.</p>

<p><strong>WHY YOU NEED A VPN:</strong></p>
<p>One of the greatest benefit of using VPN is data protection. Since so much of our lives are online today, security has become a major concern.</p>
<p>VPN not only protects your online activities and personal information but also it adds an extra security layer against cybercriminals particularly if you regularly access the public networks.</p>
<p>A VPN creates a secure tunnel thus allowing you to keep your private data safe from malicious actors.</p>
<p><strong>IS VPN WORTH PAYING:</strong></p>
<p>If you can relate to any of the aforementioned scenarios, One thing is for sure that you need a good VPN. As far as this question is concerned , then the answer is YES , a VPN is worth buying. Why not, when you can have all those advantages of a VPN by paying just a few dollars per month?</p>
<p><strong>FREE VPN’s : A NIGHTMARE:</strong></p>
<p>“Free” isn’t free when it comes to free VPN’s. using free VPN’s is just like protecting your privacy at the expense of your own privacy. These services actually allow malicious third parties to sneak through your personal data and much more. VPN’s are meant to protect you from all these malicious activities, so it’s better to pay some amount rather than compromising your privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SELLING A VPN: A VPN RESELLER PROGRAM</strong></p>
<p>One can boost up the revenues by selling VPN using VPN reselling program , which is designed to offer internet/digital marketers the opportunity to sell VPN services provided by another company. They provide the marketer with all back-end tools and server’s access.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong><br>WHY RESELL VPN’s:</strong></p>
<p>The VPN market is at the top of its game now and user as well as business privacy concerns are bigger than ever. Before, VPNs were mostly used among companies and universities for the sole ability to access private data and resources. Now, VPN services are an everyday thing, used by Internet users all around the globe. Data leaks, Internet restrictions, privacy-unfriendly laws are just a few reasons as to why the VPN market has skyrocketed and will continue to grow. VPN resells are increasing too, as many want to jump on the train and take advantage of the growing VPN service provider market.</p>
<p><strong>UNDERSTANDING VPN PROTOCOLS</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>VPN protocols are designed with the sole purpose of facilitating the encapsulation and encryption of data transmitting via network.</p>
<p>As a VPN reseller, it would help to understand the different VPN protocols. Among many different types there are few that are commonly used.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Point to point tunneling protocol (PPTP):</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This protocol encapsulates and encrypt data using IP header and it can be used for both remote-access and site to site VPN connections.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Cisco developed this protocol and it uses elements of PPTP and layer 2 Forwarding. It combines the aspects of both technologies in single protocol and adds an extra layer of security at transport level.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Secure Socket Tunneling protocols (SSTP)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is one of the latest technology that has that has advantage of getting through firewalls and web proxies that have been known to block PPTP and L2TP. The encapsulation is done using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) channel on HTTPS protocol.</p>
